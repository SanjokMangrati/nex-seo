# Nex SEO Landing Page

This is a clean and modern landing page built for a fictional company called **Nex SEO**. The project helped me improve my CSS skills, design more professional layout and gave a rough overview to adding interactive animations using **Framer Motion**. This project was built with **Next.js 14**, **Dot Lottie**, **Framer Motion**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**.
